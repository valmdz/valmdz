I am Valentina, a front-End developer with a background in Sustainable Architecture. 

A couple of years ago, I started to transition my career towards the IT field, so I began by learning about UX and UI. I then joined a 7.5 months intensive web-development bootcamp at an organization called Hack your Future where I learned the modern principles of full stack development. 

I have a huge interest in building meaningful and well crafted projects with inspiring people, putting a great emphasis on the quality of the code, user experience and responsiveness.
